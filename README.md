# LIP-CMS Operation Center: Documentation

This repository holds some documentation on the remote CMS operation center @ IST (see the code and scripts [here](https://github.com/cbeiraod/LIPCMS-OperationCenter)).

## How to contribute

In order to contribute, follow the normal guidelines for working with repositories, i.e:

1. Create your own fork of the repository (click the button you can see in the top right of this page)
2. Edit your fork of the repository with whatever updates you see fit (it's normally a good idea to clone the repository locally so you can work on your own computer). Add these changes in as many commits as you wish
3. Create a pull request with the changes you have made against this central repository

## For maintainers

This repository is intentionally kept separate from the repository that is actually displayed as the wiki on the main repository for the remote operation center (see [here](https://github.com/cbeiraod/LIPCMS-OperationCenter)).
Once this repository is updated and is deemed in a finalized state, the changes have to be pushed to the wiki.
In order to do this, you must add a remote repository to your local repository (search for `git remote add`) pointing to the wiki (you can see more details [here](https://nerds.inn.org/2014/05/19/applying-git-to-github-wikis/)).
Then all that is needed is to push the latest version to the correct remote repository.
